            It is with a great sense of humility, excitement and determination
            that I share my first thoughts with you. Kotak is one of the largest
            financial conglomerates in India, with a stellar reputation, a
            strong brand, global standards of governance, a prudent risk
            management mindset, and a dedicated management team. Therefore, it
            is no surprise that Kotak has delivered excellent financial results,
            growing consolidated Profit After Tax at a 5-year CAGR of 20.4%–
            fiscal year 2023-24 being no exception.
            <br />
            The credit goes to Uday Kotak, who has built this exceptional
            business, directed its growth from a bill discounting business to
            the most diverse financial organisation in the country today. His
            incredible attention to detail and to first principles have been
            pivotal in navigating difficult situations over the last few
            decades, such as the NBFC crisis, global financial meltdown,
            COVID-19 pandemic, etc. Uday’s ability to build a strong management
            team that embodies entrepreneurial energy has been instrumental in
            our success over these years. Words cannot sufficiently express the
            institutional building that he has achieved. And this is exactly
            what we want to sustain – a preeminent institution that outlives
            generations! <br />

        I am humbled and grateful that I have been chosen to lead our company
        into its next phase of growth. I sincerely believe that we are extremely
        well poised to take this franchise to the next level. In a way, I have
        trained for 35 years across every geography in the world to take on this
        opportunity.
        <br />
        Of course, the Indian economy and the Indian drive and determination are
        clear tailwinds. India’s growth trajectory, both in terms of stature and
        prominence, achieved on its own terms, is truly inspiring. Over the
        years, I have seen this first hand while managing businesses in India
        from abroad. As an Indian, my heart swelled with pride regardless of the
        geography that I was in. This, coupled with all the internal building
        blocks that we have, gives me a great sense of excitement and energy as
        we take this institution to the next level. This is also what drives my
        determination.
        <br />
        I am deeply committed to ensuring that our key stakeholders are proud of
        the Kotak Group and the Group achieves its rightful position in the
        financial services industry. That then brings me to our core strategy
        for the next phase –

        <p>
          The most important stakeholder is our Customer. In all my 35 years of
          working experience, one lesson stands out: if you get it right by the
          customer, everything else will fall into place. If you don’t get it
          right by the customer, then nothing else matters. At Kotak, we are
          deeply determined to get it right by our customers by understanding
          their needs and building appropriate propositions and thus being the
          right partner to them – which sometimes may even mean saying no. The
          good news is that we have a comprehensive range of products and
          services within Kotak, enabling us to fulfil our promises. We assure
          our customers that we will make it easier for them to do business with
          us.

              Every single financial product and service that we provide is a
              means to an end rather than the end in itself. Hence, making sure
              that we are there and deliver for the customer on their terms
              becomes critical. Getting this right will lead to our customers
              rewarding us with their loyalty and business. In turn, this
              approach will help us scale our business and expand market share.
              Where we already have a good market share, we will aim to maintain
              our position while simultaneously driving growth in other business
              segments.

          You give us the capital to run our Company, and it is our commitment
          to deliver to you – to build a great company that you can be proud of.
          And an institution that delivers sustainable and consistent financial
          returns.
          <br />
          On a consolidated basis in FY 2023-24, our Net Profit grew at 22% YoY
          to ₹ 18,213 crore translating into a strong Return on Assets of 2.66%.
          As on 31st March 2024, our Networth was ₹ 129,892 crore, Book Value
          per Share was ₹ 653 and Capital Adequacy Ratio stood at 21.8%. Total
          Assets Under Management was over ₹ 5,60,000 crore.
          <br />
          At the Bank standalone level, our customer base grew to over 5 crore,
          Net Profit grew 26% YoY to ₹ 13,782 crore and Net Interest Margin
          stood at 5.32%. Year on Year we grew our deposits and Advances by over
          20% while maintaining credit cost at 45 bps.

          We recognise that you have many options, but we will demonstrate, as
          we have in the past, that we will deliver for you consistently.

          At this stage, it is appropriate to address the recent RBI order. Over
          the last few years, we had completely embraced the notion that
          leveraging technology is fundamental to growing the business. Towards
          this, we had significantly stepped up resources and investments in
          technology. However, it is evident/clear that we have more to do.
          Changing customer expectations, the dramatic pace of business growth,
          the emerging risk landscape have meant that we have to move at a much
          faster pace. We are absolutely committed to further enhancing our
          resources and commitments in this area, and I am very confident that
          collectively, as a team – we will deliver and use this as an
          opportunity to leapfrog.
          It is also very clear that technology is going to be at the centre of
          our efforts to transform and hence, scale.

          We can only achieve our goals through our greatest asset and

          everyone in the Company is to become a customer facing colleague, or
          at the very least, serve the front-line colleague facing the customer.
          We will transform our internal processes to make it easier for our
          customer-facing colleagues to meet the needs of the customer.
          <br />
          Attracting and retaining colleagues who are excited about being
          customer obsessed will be our mantra as we transform for scale.

          Another very important stakeholder is our Community. Within this, the

          the licence to do business. They essentially want us to take care of
          our customers and do that in a prudent manner. That’s exactly what the
          management team seeks to do. Hence, there is no ray of light between
          the regulators and the team.
          <br />
          More broadly, we can only thrive – if the community in which we live
          and operate thrives. It is in our self-interest to make sure that the
          community thrives. Our efforts in this regard will be reflected in the
          value of our brand.

          I am extremely proud of the CSR activity that we do as a Group,
          especially on education, livelihoods, healthcare and environmental
          sustainability. Personally, I have benefited from my family’s intense
          focus on education and sincerely believe in the adage of teach a
          person to fish and you feed them for life. Closely linked to that is
          the need to create employment and fuel entrepreneurship. That, in a
          sense, is Kotak’s legacy, and we want to Transform for scale –
          Entrepreneurship. I have been going around the country meeting many
          young people, and the confidence and sparkle in their eyes tell me
          that it is only right thing to do. That’s transforming and scaling the
          country, and as part of our community efforts, we will play our share.
          <br />
          These are, no doubt, ambitious goals, but we are not playing for the
          short term. Our commitment to you is to demonstrate consistent
          progress against these goals.
          <br />
          In conclusion, I want to leave you with one last thought – as your
          management team, we will build a sustainable, high performing
          organisation. Our journey ahead is filled with opportunities and
          challenges, and I am confident that with your continued support, we
